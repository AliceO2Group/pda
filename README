2__Installation

Requirements for Linux:

- Installed GCC
- Installed libtool
- libpci and related headers (comes with pciutils)
- libkmod and related headers 
- libnuma and related headers (comes with numactl)
- Doxygen (if the documentation is needed)

Type:
./configure --help
./configure <options>
make
make install

cd patches/<operating system>/
make install


3__Documentation
The PDA is documented with doxygen. Therefore Doxygen must be installed to get 
a full reference manual (tested with version 1.8.4).

Type:
make doc

Look into the subfolder doxygen/


4__Compatibility

- Linux between 2.6.29 and 3.19


5__Known Issues

- Older versions of libpci leak memory. It is therefore recommended to update
libpci to version 3.3.1 or newer. Otherwise the device description string might
not be available.
